    Given I log in as "Instructor01" user
    When I navigate to "Resources"
    And I create a "Question Bank" resource with:

      | Description              | Resource Description |

    And I add a "True/False" question with:
      | Title          | Test Question 1 |
      | Correct Answer | False           |
    And I add a "Short-Answer/Essay Question" question with:
      | Title           | What is a subnet mask? |
      | Character Limit | 300                    |
